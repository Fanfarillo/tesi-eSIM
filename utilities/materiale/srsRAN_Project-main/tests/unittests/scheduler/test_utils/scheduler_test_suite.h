/// \brief In this file, we provide a list of common checks to verify the validity of the scheduler output for a given
/// cell configuration. To maximize their applicability, these chosen checks should solely depend on the (assumed
/// immutable) cell configuration, and shouldn't depend on the scheduler or UE states. We assume that unit tests
/// checks should cover the latter cases.
