 * This file will hold the interfaces and notifiers for the RLC entity.
 * They follow the following nomenclature:
 *
 *   rlc_{tx/rx}_{lower/upper}_layer_{[control/data]}_{interface/notifier}
 *
 * 1. TX/RX indicates whether the interface is intended for the
 *    TX or RX side of the entity
 * 2. Lower/Upper indicates whether the interface/notifier interacts
 *    with the upper or lower layers.
 * 3. Control/Data: indicates whether this interface is necessary for "control"
 *    purposes (e.g., notifying the RRC of protocol error) or "data" purposes
 *    (e.g. handling PDUs).
 *    This distinction is only necessary when interfacing with the upper layers,
 *    and as such, we omit it in the interfaces with the lower layers.
 * 4. Interface/Notifier: whether this is an interface the RLC entity will
 *    inherit or a notifier that the RLC will keep as a member.
