/// The demodulation mapper reverts the operations described in TS38.211 Section 5.1. It takes as input a sequence of
/// noisy, complex-valued modulation symbols and it returns a sequence of log-likelihood ratios (soft bits). More
/// specifically, the \f$m\f$th modulation symbol will be mapped to the soft bits
/// \f[
/// \ell(b_{m+i}) = \log \frac{\Pr(b_{m+i}=0|y_m)}{\Pr(b_{m+i}=1|y_m)}
/// \f]
/// where \f$i = 0,1,\dots,Q_{\textup{m}}-1\f$, with \f$Q_{\textup{m}}\f$ denoting the modulation order as defined in
/// TS38.211 Table 6.3.1.2-1, and where \f$\Pr(b_{m+i}=B|y_m)\f$ is the conditional probability of bit \f$b_{m+i}\f$
/// being equal to \f$B\f$ given the modulation symbol \f$y_m\f$.
