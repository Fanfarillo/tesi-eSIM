/// \brief Implementation of a downlink processor.
///
/// This implementation process the PDUs and config using one executor, which
/// hides the execution threading model. The implementation ensures that all the PDUs and configs will be processed
/// before transmitting the resource grid through the gateway, even if finish_processing_pdus() method is called before
/// every PDU is processed.
/// \note This implementation follows the same method order that the interface. Not following this order will result in
/// undefined behaviour. As a reminder, the order is the following: first configure the downlink processor by calling
/// configure_resource_grid(). After it is configured it can start to process PDUs. Finally, when no more PDUs need to
/// be processed, finish_processing_pdus() can be called so the grid can be send through the gateway. Note that
/// finish_processing_pdus() can be called before the PDUs finished processing, but the resource grid is sent through
/// the gateway as soon as every enqueued PDU before finish_processing_pdus() is processed . This is controlled counting
/// the PDUs that are processed and finished processing.
///  \note Thread safe class.
